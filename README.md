* Reflection Questions and Answers:
1. If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
* If I had more time, I would love to add interactive images and an image slider. I think pictures are a great way to connect with users because everyone has different ways of interperating information. While some people enjoy reading information, others enjoy looking at images for further context. If I were to add interactive images, they would provide the users with additional context of my hobbies and interests, and the slideshow would give examples of some of the projects I hope to accomplish one day. I think that the main challenge that I would face in adding this feature would be learning how to begin. As I was completing this project, I learned more about how HTML/CSS compliment each other, and I think that if I were to add these other features, I would have to take a step back and decide how I would begin to incorporate Javascript into my code. I would want to truly be comfortable with HTML/CSS first, and then dive into Javascript in order to provide my users the best webpage experience that I can bring.
2. Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?
* I think web accessibility is important because it acts as an extra assistance for the user. For example, I chose to add accessible naviagtion on my website because it allows users to quickly move from one section to another. When I am on a website that I do not normally use, I find it comforting to know that there is a button in the corner that I can easily access to get back to the homepage in case I lose track of what I am doing. Web accessibility allows individuals with disabilities, or those who are not used to working with technology, the ability to explore a website with comfort and assurance. It is truly important to consider all types of users when designing a website, to ensure that everyone is receiving optimal experience.
