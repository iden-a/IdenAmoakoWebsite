* Answer to the Reflection Questions 

1. What skills and experiences are you hoping to take away from this program? How does this align with your personal and professional interests and goals?

* One thing I would hope to take away from this program is the ability to not only improve on my technical skills but to be able to work with like minded individuals who are on the same path as I am. I would like to be in an environment that correlates with my aspiring goal of that intersection between business and technology. Whether it be software engineering mentors or product managers that I would be working with, I would like to work alongside engineers to see what their thought processes are like and managers to see how they deal with the difficulties that they face on a day to day basis. I hope to not only learn more about myself in terms of career development but also in personal terms. To be able to be in a completely new environment for three months and focus on growth and acceleration would truly be an enlightening experience and that would remain a crucial part of my overall development as I am navigating that career and academic aspect of these next few years.


2. How can websites or applications promote activism or support a community or cause? Share a specific example of a website that does this and why you picked it.

* I think in this particular instance, a website should really focus on that "About‚Äù and mission statement section of their home page. For instance, if a website is created to support the education and funding for underrepresented youth, they should have accessible buttons and links that take people directly to a page where they can learn more and figure out ways that they can personally help. That home page and that main menu should really focus on that organization or company's motto, what they are hoping to do for the community, and what steps they will be taking to help the community. I think that the NYC Cares Website is a great example of a website that promotes activities and the support of the community. It not only offers forms of activism, but it allows a variety of ways for people within NYC to sign up as volunteers and even be of leadership in their own activist groups. For those who are unable to commit a huge portion of their day to volunteering, they offer other ways such as donations as a form of support. I think that NYC Cares really embodies that idea of an application that supports a cause because not only does the website offer so much information about each borough within NYC, but it allows people to go on the website, figure out how they can help. If you're the one in need of help there are so many ways to figure out what location you can go to to get some food, to get some clothing, or to get some jackets for the cold weather. I feel like that website really showcases what it means to be a community and to help those who are in need.


3. If you are unsure about a concept or run into a bug, how might you go about asking for help? Who would you ask and why? How might you phrase your questions? 

* In a learning environment such as the FutureForce Tech Launchpad Program, I think that the other students that I would be working side by side with would be an important tool and resource for my educational advancement. I have always been told that if you have a question 9 times out of 10 someone else either has that same question or the answer to it. I would ask one of the students that I am working with if they know how to fix the issue or if they have encountered an issue like this before. If no one is able to answer my question, then I would ask one of my instructors or a mentor about my issue and see if we can work through it to find a solution. I really do believe that in situations like that you can learn a lot from the people you are working with and that they are an important asset towards your educational advancement. 


4. What are 3 questions you would ask your mentor and why? 

* How did you know you wanted to become a software engineer, and when did you begin your journey?
- We each have different upbringings and we each come from different communities and that really does play a major part in what kind of careers we wish to pursue I know that up until recently I wasn't really sure what field and what part of the business operations sector I wanted to be a part of So I feel like this question would not only give me insight, but it would allow me to relate to my mentor on another level.

* What keeps you motivated to pursue the work you are currently doing? 
- We all have different motivations, whether we want to support our families or we want to further ourselves in our careers. There are a whole variety of motivations that allow us to wake up and head to work. I would like to know what drives my mentor,  and what keeps them motivated even when they are not feeling like the best version of themselves.

* If you had any previous mentees, what qualities did they possess that allowed them to be successful? And if you haven't, if you've ever worked with any partners or if you've had any mentors who prepared you and aided in your career advancement, what qualities did they possess?
- This question is important because I would like to know what qualities allow someone to be successful in their respective field. Regardless of technical skills, interpersonal skills are also extremely important so I feel like these questions would give me further insight on what it means to collaborate, and work in a team, as well as to be an engineer in that particular field.
